## Congressional Summary – October 2025

October 2025 exposes the accelerating fracture in the global monetary order, a modern replay of **Triffin’s Dilemma on steroids**. The U.S. dollar, still the world’s reserve currency, requires endless trade deficits and money printing to sustain global liquidity—yet each new Treasury auction and Fed balance sheet expansion erodes confidence. With **national debt now exceeding $36 trillion** and the Fed’s post-September rate cut fueling asset inflation without wage growth, the system is structurally broken. Bitcoin surges past **$72,000** as institutional flight from fiat accelerates.

Key milestones:  
- **CLARITY Act** clears Senate Banking Committee (Oct 8), heads to full vote.  
- **BITCOIN Act** attached to NDAA; 1M BTC strategic reserve gains bipartisan momentum.  
- **GENIUS Act** stablecoin rules go live Nov 1; major issuers (Circle, Tether) achieve full federal compliance.  
- **Solana ETF decision delayed to Nov 15** amid SEC-CFTC harmonization fallout.  
- **Treasury issues first Bitcoin custody guidelines** under EO 14178 (Oct 22).

## Congressional Summary – November 2025

November crystallizes the **post-Triffin monetary shift**. The U.S. officially begins treating Bitcoin as a **strategic reserve asset**—a direct response to dollar debasement. The **NDAA passes with BITCOIN Act intact** (Nov 18), authorizing the first 50,000 BTC purchase in Q1 2026. **CLARITY Act signed into law Nov 12**, reclassifying Bitcoin and proof-of-work assets as commodities. **GENIUS Act compliance deadline hits Nov 1**—all major stablecoins now federally licensed.

Bitcoin breaks **$85,000** on reserve news. Global central banks (Switzerland, Japan) quietly inquire about U.S. BTC custody standards.
