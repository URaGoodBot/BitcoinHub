## Congressional Summary

September 2025 underscores the fragility of the US monetary system, reminiscent of Triffin's Dilemma—the inherent conflict in the Bretton Woods era where the dollar's role as global reserve currency necessitated chronic US trade deficits to provide world liquidity, ultimately undermining confidence and leading to the 1971 Nixon Shock that severed the gold peg. Today, with national debt surpassing $35 trillion and the Federal Reserve's balance sheet bloated from quantitative easing, persistent deficits and money printing erode dollar hegemony, fostering inflation and currency debasement. This broken fiat paradigm, where short-term political expediency trumps fiscal discipline, positions Bitcoin as an indispensable, decentralized bulwark against systemic risks. Amid the FOMC's recent 0.25% rate cut on September 17—easing policy to combat cooling inflation yet signaling deeper liquidity injections—crypto markets surged, with Bitcoin reclaiming $65,000 as a hedge. Key developments include Senate pushes for CLARITY Act market structure by month-end, BITCOIN Act advancements toward a national reserve, GENIUS Act stablecoin implementations bolstering dollar-pegged assets, and the SEC-CFTC roundtable on harmonization. Solana ETF reviews persist amid delays, while White House EO 14178 implementations accelerate DeFi and custody rules, all amplifying Bitcoin's strategic role in a dilemma-plagued economy.

## Next Major Event

**SEC-CFTC Joint Roundtable on Regulatory Harmonization**  
*September 29, 2025*  
Agencies will explore unified oversight for digital assets, including Bitcoin spot and derivatives markets, to streamline rules post-GENIUS Act. This builds on the FOMC's dovish September 16-17 cut, potentially enhancing crypto liquidity amid Triffin-esque global dollar strains.
