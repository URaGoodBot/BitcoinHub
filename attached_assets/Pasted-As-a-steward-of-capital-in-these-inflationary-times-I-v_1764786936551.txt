As a steward of capital in these inflationary times, I've long held that true wealth preservation demands vigilance over the fiat spigot—the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and its shadowy plumbing. Like Buffett eyeing a moat, Saylor stacking sats against debasement, or Cowen charting macro cycles, we must monitor money supply distortions not just for their scale, but for the anomalies that precede regime shifts. Spikes in reverse repos signal excess liquidity sloshing around, draining into safe havens; Treasury General Account drawdowns can flood reserves overnight; currency hoarding hints at distrust in digital rails. These aren't mere lines on a graph—they're the Fed's fingerprints on velocity, potentially telegraphing everything from rate cuts to crypto winters.

Based on a deep dive into FRED's vaults (the St. Louis Fed's treasure trove of 800,000+ series), here are eight of the most telling indicators for money supply irregularities. I've prioritized weekly/daily granularity where possible for real-time tracking, focusing on core aggregates, liquidity drains, and balance sheet levers. Each ties directly to potential distortions: rapid M2 growth, RRP surges as "shadow sterilization," TGA swings as fiscal injections, etc. I've included series IDs, frequencies, and why they matter, with links to FRED for visuals.

| Series ID | Title | Frequency | Why It Tracks Irregularities | FRED Link |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------------------------|-----------|
| M2SL | M2 Money Stock | Monthly | Broad money supply gauge (cash + deposits + near-monies); YoY spikes >10% often precede inflation or asset bubbles, as seen in 2020-21. | [View on FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) |
| M1SL | M1 Money Stock | Monthly | Narrowest measure (cash + checking); exploded post-COVID due to QE—watch for velocity traps or sudden contractions signaling credit crunches. | [View on FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL) |
| RRPONTSYD | Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Sold by Fed | Daily | "Parking lot" for excess cash; jumps >$2T indicate liquidity hoarding, sterilizing money supply growth and pressuring yields lower. | [View on FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD) |
| WTREGEN | U.S. Treasury General Account: Week Average | Weekly | Government's "checking account" at Fed; drawdowns inject reserves (boosting effective money supply), while builds drain it—key for QT/QE pivots. | [View on FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WTREGEN) |
| WALCL | Total Assets (Fed Balance Sheet) | Weekly | Fed's full firepower; expansions >$1T/quarter scream monetization, correlating with M2 surges and risk-on rallies (or crypto pumps). | [View on FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL) |
| WRESBAL | Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks: Week Average | Weekly | Bank excess reserves; floods here (> $3T) mute rate signals, but rapid drains can spike interbank rates and money velocity. | [View on FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WRESBAL) |
| CURRCIR | Currency in Circulation | Monthly | Physical dollars abroad/hoarded; steady climbs amid digital shifts signal de-dollarization fears or black-market demand, distorting M1/M2. | [View on FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CURRCIR) |
| BOGMBASE | Monetary Base: Total | Monthly | High-powered money (reserves + currency); divergences from M2 highlight multiplier breakdowns, like in 2008 or 2022's "stealth QT." | [View on FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGMBASE) |

These form a dashboard for spotting "irregularities"—e.g., RRP + TGA inversions often precede Fed interventions. Cross-reference with FEDFUNDS (effective rate) for context, but start here for purity.

To automate tracking in Replit (a fine sandbox for macro scripts, akin to TradingView but with Python's edge), I've crafted a starter `main.py` file. It fetches live data via the FRED API (free, but grab your key at [fred.stlouisfed.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)—treat it like a vault code). Run `pip install fredapi pandas matplotlib` in Replit's shell first. The script pulls the latest observations, computes YoY growth (flagging >5% anomalies as "alerts"), saves to CSV for export/analysis, and plots M2 as a baseline chart. Tweak thresholds or add Pine-like indicators (e.g., EMAs via TA-Lib) as you scale.

Copy-paste this into Replit as `main.py` and hit run— it'll prompt for your API key on first go.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from fredapi import Fred
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Prompt for API key (or use env var for security)
api_key = input("Enter your FRED API key (or press Enter if set as FRED_API_KEY env var): ").strip() or os.getenv('FRED_API_KEY')
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("API key required. Get one at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html")

fred = Fred(api_key=api_key)

print("\nRun periodically via cron/scheduler in Replit for ongoing surveillance. Scale with alerts to email/Slack.")
```

This setup gives you a Buffett-grade overview: simple, compounding insights over time. Feed the CSV into TradingView for Pine Script overlays (e.g., plot M2 vs. BTCUSD for debasement ratios), or expand to anomaly detection with statsmodels. If irregularities spike—say, RRP draining while TGA builds—it's time to lean into hard assets. Questions on tweaks or crypto tie-ins? Fire away.
