Below is a detailed game concept designed for your Replit agent to develop, tailored for the "Boomer" generation (broadly defined as older adults, typically 55+). The game aims to educate players about Bitcoin’s origins, key events, and concepts like Satoshi Nakamoto, Operation Chokepoint 2.0, the FTX collapse, and the use of stablecoins in real-world settings like farmers' markets. The design prioritizes accessibility, simplicity, and engagement to appeal to an audience that may not be tech-sav “‘Bitcoin Quest: Rise to Riches” is an interactive, story-driven, choice-based game with a point-and-click interface, designed to teach Boomers about Bitcoin’s history and ecosystem through a relatable narrative and engaging mechanics. The game uses simple language, intuitive controls, and a familiar setting to make complex crypto concepts digestible.

### Game Overview
- **Title**: Bitcoin Quest: Rise to Riches
- **Genre**: Educational Adventure / Point-and-Click / Interactive Story
- **Platform**: Web-based (Replit-compatible, accessible via browser)
- **Target Audience**: Boomers (55+), with minimal tech or crypto knowledge
- **Objective**: Players assume the role of a retiree exploring Bitcoin’s origins and evolution, making choices that teach them about key events, figures, and concepts in a fun, narrative-driven way.
- **Tone**: Lighthearted, approachable, with a touch of humor and relatable analogies (e.g., comparing Bitcoin to “digital gold” or stablecoins to “gift cards”).
- **Setting**: A small-town farmers' market in 2025, where the player learns about crypto through interactions with vendors, neighbors, and historical “flashbacks” to Bitcoin’s milestones.

### Game Mechanics
1. **Point-and-Click Exploration**:
   - Players navigate a 2D farmers' market with clickable stalls, characters, and objects.
   - Each interaction (e.g., talking to a vendor or examining a sign) triggers a mini-lesson or dialogue about a Bitcoin-related topic.
   - Simple controls: mouse clicks or taps for navigation, with large, clear buttons for accessibility.

2. **Choice-Based Narrative**:
   - Players make decisions that shape the story, such as whether to buy Bitcoin, use stablecoins, or investigate historical events.
   - Choices lead to educational outcomes (e.g., choosing to “learn about Satoshi” triggers a flashback to 2008).
   - Incorrect choices are forgiving, offering gentle corrections and explanations to reinforce learning.

3. **Mini-Games for Engagement**:
   - **Mining Puzzle**: A simple matching game where players “mine” Bitcoin by solving basic puzzles (e.g., matching blocks to form a chain), teaching how Bitcoin’s blockchain works.
   - **Stablecoin Trading**: Players use stablecoins to buy goods at the farmers' market, learning about price stability and fiat-backed tokens.
   - **FTX Fallout Quiz**: A multiple-choice quiz about the FTX collapse, with feedback explaining fraud and risk management.
   - **Chokepoint 2.0 Dodge**: A timed challenge where players avoid “regulatory obstacles” (e.g., bank closures) to keep their crypto safe, illustrating regulatory challenges.

4. **Progression and Rewards**:
   - Players earn “Sats” (Satoshis, the smallest Bitcoin unit) for completing tasks, which can be spent on in-game upgrades (e.g., better market stall visuals) or saved to demonstrate wealth preservation.
   - A “Knowledge Journal” tracks learned concepts, with summaries of Bitcoin’s history, stablecoins, and more, serving as a reference players can revisit.

### Story and Structure
#### Premise
You’re Pat, a retiree in a small town in 2025, curious about Bitcoin after hearing vendors at the local farmers' market accept it.
