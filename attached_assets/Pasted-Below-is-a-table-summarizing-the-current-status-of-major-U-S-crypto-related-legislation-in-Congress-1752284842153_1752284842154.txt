Below is a table summarizing the current status of major U.S. crypto-related legislation in Congress as of July 11, 2025, based on available information. The table includes the bill name, current status, next steps, estimated percentage chance of passing the next phase, and what’s next for each bill. Note that the percentage chances are rough estimates based on bipartisan support, political climate, and reported momentum, as precise probabilities are not explicitly provided in sources. The information reflects the latest developments, primarily focusing on stablecoin and broader crypto market structure bills.

| **Bill Name** | **Current Status** | **Next Steps** | **% Chance of Passing Next Phase** | **What's Next** |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins)** | Passed the Senate on June 17, 2025, with a 68-30 bipartisan vote. | The bill has been sent to the House for consideration during "Crypto Week" (July 14-18, 2025). The House may vote on it as is, amend it, or reconcile it with its own stablecoin legislation. | 75% - The House has shown strong crypto support, with a Republican majority and bipartisan backing for similar legislation (e.g., FIT21 passed with 71 Democrats). However, reconciling differences between Senate and House versions and addressing Democratic concerns about conflicts of interest (e.g., Trump’s crypto ventures) could pose challenges. | If passed by the House, the bill will go to conference to reconcile Senate and House versions (if amended) or directly to President Trump for signing. Trump has pushed for a stablecoin bill by August, increasing urgency. |[](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-landmark-crypto-regulation-bill-bipartisan-vote-sending-rcna213437)[](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/genius-stablecoin-bill-crypto.html)[](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=410793)
| **CLARITY Act (Digital Asset Market Clarity Act)** | Advanced through House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees with strong bipartisan votes on June 10, 2025. Scheduled for House floor vote during "Crypto Week" (July 14-18, 2025). | Full House vote to pass the bill, which defines regulatory roles for the SEC and CFTC over crypto assets. | 70% - The bill has momentum from committee approvals and bipartisan support, but the narrow Republican House majority and potential Democratic pushback on regulatory scope could complicate passage. | If passed by the House, the bill will move to the Senate for consideration. Senate passage may be tougher due to its broader scope compared to the GENIUS Act, potentially requiring amendments or negotiations. |[](https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1940909558303490503)[](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/11/senate-begins-passage-of-stablecoin-bill-as-house-marks-market-structure-wins)[](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/11/senate-begins-passage-of-stablecoin-bill-as-house-marks-market-structure-wins)
| **Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act** | Announced for consideration during "Crypto Week" (July 14-18, 2025) in the House. No recent votes or committee actions reported. | House committee review and markup, followed by a potential floor vote. | 60% - The bill aligns with Republican opposition to a U.S. CBDC and Trump’s executive order halting CBDC work, but limited Democratic support and lack of prior legislative progress reduce its chances compared to other bills. | If advanced through committee, the bill will face a House floor vote. Senate consideration would follow, but its fate depends on broader crypto legislative momentum and political priorities. |[](https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1940909558303490503)[](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=410793)[](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/what-is-next-for-crypto-regulation-in-the-us/)
| **BITCOIN Act of 2024** | Introduced in the Senate on July 30, 2024, to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. No recent votes or advancements reported. | Senate Banking Committee review and potential markup to advance the bill. | 40% - The bill lacks recent traction and faces skepticism due to its ambitious proposal (e.g., purchasing 1 million Bitcoins over five years). Bipartisan support is uncertain, and funding concerns may deter progress. | If advanced by the Senate, the bill would move to the House. Its controversial funding model and limited momentum suggest a long road ahead. |[](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912/all-info)[](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912/all-info)[](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912/all-info)
| **H.J.Res.25 (Repeal of IRS DeFi Broker Rule)** | Passed the House on March 11, 2025, with a bipartisan 279-136 vote. | Senate consideration and vote under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the Biden-era IRS DeFi Broker Rule. | 65% - The strong House vote (including 76 Democrats) suggests moderate Senate support, but Democratic concerns about consumer protections and Senate Banking Committee dynamics could pose hurdles. | If passed by the Senate, the bill would go to President Trump for signing. It aligns with the administration’s push to reduce crypto regulatory burdens. |[](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/03/12/house-passes-ways-means-legislation-to-rollback-biden-administrations-midnight-crypto-rule-in-bipartisan-vote/)[](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/03/12/house-passes-ways-means-legislation-to-rollback-biden-administrations-midnight-crypto-rule-in-bipartisan-vote/)[](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/03/12/house-passes-ways-means-legislation-to-rollback-biden-administrations-midnight-crypto-rule-in-bipartisan-vote/)

### Notes:
- **GENIUS Act**: This bill is the furthest along, having cleared the Senate. Its focus on stablecoins, which have broad industry and bipartisan support, makes it the most likely to progress. However, House amendments or attempts to pair it with broader market structure legislation could delay final passage.[](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-landmark-crypto-regulation-bill-bipartisan-vote-sending-rcna213437)[](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/crypto-stablecoins-senate)
- **CLARITY Act**: As a broader market structure bill, it faces more complexity than the GENIUS Act but benefits from recent committee successes and a pro-crypto Congress. Senate passage remains uncertain due to its scope.[](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/11/senate-begins-passage-of-stablecoin-bill-as-house-marks-market-structure-wins)
- **Anti-CBDC Act**: This bill reflects Republican priorities but has less visible momentum and bipartisan support, making its path less clear.[](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/what-is-next-for-crypto-regulation-in-the-us/)
- **BITCOIN Act**: This is the least advanced, with no recent progress reported. Its ambitious scope and lack of bipartisan backing make passage unlikely in the near term.[](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912/all-info)
- **H.J.Res.25**: The strong House vote signals good momentum, but Senate dynamics and Democratic concerns about DeFi oversight could slow progress.[](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/2025/03/12/house-passes-ways-means-legislation-to-rollback-biden-administrations-midnight-crypto-rule-in-bipartisan-vote/)
