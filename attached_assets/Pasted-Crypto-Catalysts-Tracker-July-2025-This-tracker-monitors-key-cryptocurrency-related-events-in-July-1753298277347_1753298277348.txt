Notes

Probabilities: Estimated based on web sources and X sentiment as of July 23, 2025. Subject to change with new developments.
Market Impact: Positive outcomes (e.g., report release, ETF approval, dovish FOMC) could drive 5-20% crypto market rallies and 5-15% gains in crypto stocks (e.g., COIN, MSTR). Restrictive policies may cause 5-10% dips.
Risks: Verify X posts against primary sources (whitehouse.gov, sec.gov) to avoid misinformation. Regulatory delays or lawsuits (e.g., SEC vs. Coinbase) may impact ETF approvals.
Using Grok: Query Grok every 2–3 days for updates (e.g., “Any crypto catalyst updates for July 2025?”). Memory of this conversation will be retained for context unless you choose to forget it via “Data Controls” or the book icon.
