Here are two fun, educational Bitcoin-themed games tailored for Boomers and Millennials, designed to deepen understanding and empower escape from the fiat system's challenges. Each game uses interactive mechanics, real 2025 data, and actionable insights, aligning with the previous games' styles (e.g., *What Happened in 1971?* inspiration). Both track progress with points or meters and include quizzes or choices to engage players. These can be text-based or expanded into apps with visuals/charts.
